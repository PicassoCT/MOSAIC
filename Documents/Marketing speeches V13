 where everything is on the menue, you can bring a recipe for. We can make it!
You can even watch it being cooked! And you get kickbacks, if other guests order what you had.
Its that good, because you made it. Its not Mama, not the Maid, its a Robo-Kitchenaid!

Leave the world, leave your body, become one with the divine!

For some this might look like angering the gods, but this is the sweatspot riskwise. So protest away!
