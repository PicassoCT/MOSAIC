Just like Mama made it! Noticed how most restaurants are just ingredients-kit-kitchens? Add whatever, stir 3 times,
let the algo mix them, fry them, rearrange them? We automated that for restaurants and now - we give you
the ultimate restaurant- where you dont order, but just give your recipe. And they make it,
just like in the recipe- you can even watch it being made! And you get kickbacks, if other guests order what you had.
Its that good, because you made it. Its not Mama, not the Maid, its a RoboChef-Kitchenaid! 

Stressed out by the world? Meditating, but the stressors wont are relentless?

Donate your worldly things, to charity!  Dissolve yourself!
Leave the world, leave your body behind, become one with the divine!
