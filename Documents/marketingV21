You are hereby formally informed, in the presence of a witness, that the property or properties you are currently marketing, trading, or representing may lie within areas identified by insurance and environmental risk models as subject to increased and foreseeable flooding due to extreme rainfall events, among other environmental hazards.

This material risk is not currently reflected in market prices, nor transparently disclosed to all prospective buyers. However, you are now explicitly made aware that:

    The actual risk-adjusted value of the properties may be significantly lower than current market valuations;

    Failure to disclose these risks to potential buyers may constitute material omission, actionable under consumer protection, tort, or fraud statutes;

    You are now under obligation to either:

        Provide a full written and verbal disclaimer of these environmental risks to every client and counterparty; or

        Refrain from further market activity in these assets, recognizing that continued participation now implies willful exposure to and transmission of this risk, with possible civil and financial liability.

You cannot claim ignorance of these risks from this point forward.
