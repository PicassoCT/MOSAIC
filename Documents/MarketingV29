Stories define what people believe they can do… and what they’re too afraid to even consider.
Now you can automate them.
With TryRant.
TryRant tailors AI-driven narratives to inspire obedience, deny behavior, and pre-kill rebellion before it forms.
“But I want to go to that festival, dad!” becomes:
“Music is sin. Sin is weakness. Weakness is hell. And our grandfather? He guarded camps. You’ll inherit his duty.”
Not because it’s true.
Because it works.

TryRant does the dirty work— planting guilt, fear, and tradition like landmines in the mind.
The perfect story is the perfect leash.
And the perfect contraceptive.
TryRant — social air superiority.
