Have you ever wondered what makes Panopticon corporations and social networks so uniquely valuable?
It’s not innovation.It’s not community. It’s not connection. It’s leverage.
Because we know what you did last summer. The tax doddging, the little affair, the degrading sex, the risk hidden in your work, the small time drug dealing. And more importantly—we know the IRS doesn’t know. Our silence isn’t just golden - its platinum.
It’s worth exactly the price of  all those little “mistakes”… minus one euronin.
And of course, if you purchase shares, it becomes everyone’s best interest to forget the entire affair - for now.

Harmony in a society, is all important. The Panopticon is what makes it possible for you to trust one another. Again.
Just the other day, in this very city, a person tried to steal a car, shot a policemen, shat in the policemens helmet, send that to the grieving widdow and stole the helmet again. And he did download his movies. We made it our lifes quest, to inform the public about  outrageous behaviour such as this.
Stay safe. Stay vigilant. Stay informed. Stay normed. Sponsored by Dys Thrust.

Harmony is fragile. Society is a thin coat of paint over feral chaos.
Just the other day, in this very city, a child was left unsupervised for days — because of course he was. Parenting is optional now. Two criminals attempted a routine burglary.
They didn’t find a helpless kid. They found a booby-trapped killhouse.
Tripwires. Blunt-force impacts. Burns. Falls. Psychological warfare.
An entire home converted into a torture maze by a smiling minor with time, tools, and imagination.
And the worst part? He didn’t survive. He enjoyed it.
This is what happens when the Panopticon blinks.
This is what your “safe neighborhood” becomes in 48 hours.
Stay safe. Stay monitored. Stay obedient.

Harmony is everything. And yet society keeps producing men who don’t break down quietly.
Just the other day, in this very city, an ordinary citizen fell apart.
He abandoned his car in traffic, armed himself with entitlement and rage, and marched through the streets “correcting” everyone: stores, restaurants, strangers, civilians.
Not a gang. Not a conspiracy.
Just one guy deciding the rules were optional.
And the city let him.
Because nobody intervenes. Nobody resists. Nobody wants paperwork.
This is what happens when the Panopticon blinks.
Stay safe. Stay compliant. Stay recorded.

Harmony is everything. The thin illusion that streets are safe. That civility still holds.
Just the other day, in this very city, a taxi driver decided he alone could fix what was broken.
Not the police. Not the courts. Not anyone sane.
Armed with obsession and rage, he stalked the streets at night, targeting anyone who “disrupted” his fragile world: pimps, petty criminals, and innocents alike.
Civilians avoided him. Authorities hesitated. Chaos spread quietly, unnoticed, unchecked.
This is the real threat: not gangs, not riots.
It’s the lone, unmonitored citizen, convinced he is justice incarnate.
Stay safe. Stay compliant. Stay in the eye.

Stories define what people believe they can do… and what they’re too afraid to even consider.
Now you can automate them.
With TryRant.
TryRant tailors AI-driven narratives to inspire obedience, deny behavior, and pre-kill rebellion before it forms.
“But I want to go to that festival, dad!” becomes:
“Music is sin. Sin is weakness. Weakness is hell. And our grandfather? He guarded camps. You’ll inherit his duty.”
Not because it’s true.
Because it works.
The best part? You stay the nice one.
TryRant does the dirty work— planting guilt, fear, and tradition like landmines in the mind.
The perfect story is the perfect leash.
And the perfect contraceptive.
TryRant — social air superiority.

We all live from credit card to credit card- the alternative would be working hard. Not adviseable!
But now, you are over the line! Deep diving in the red sea! But there is a way back, to land! Just bet on it - now at every double or nothing!


Secrets! Secrets are hard in an always-surveilled society.
Cameras. Metadata. Logs. And worst of all: people who talk.
But we can still make it happen. We can make your crimes disappear.
Because humans early out.
They see something ugly, something obvious, something “good enough”… and they stop digging. They close the file. They go home.
That’s the trick.
Hide your company’s truly monstrous secrets behind a perfectly ordinary monstrous secret.
You murdered someone? Great. Let them find that.
They’ll think they caught you. They’ll stop looking.
Meanwhile the real world-changing stuff stays buried, untouched, unimagined.
Double-insulated secrets.
The only secrecy that scales.

We all live from credit card to credit card — because the alternative is hard work, and let’s be honest: you’re not built for that. None of you are. But you? You didn’t just cross the credit line.
You pole volted over it, did a backflip, and cannonballed straight into the Red Sea of debt.

Harmony in a society is everything. The thin illusion of peace you enjoy while pretending the world isn’t a meat grinder.The Panopticon is what makes it possible for you to trust one another. Again.
Just the other day, in this very city, a group of professional criminals committed an armed robbery in broad daylight. Not desperate amateurs. Not twitchy addicts. Experts.
They walked into a bank like it belonged to them. They left with money like it was a casual withdrawal.
And when confronted by law enforcement… They didn’t run.
They conducted a military-grade firefight down the center of the street. Glass shattered. Concrete exploded. The air filled with rifle fire and the sound of our fragile society collapsing in real time.
And of course, afterwards, everyone acted surprised.
As if violence is some rare glitch. As if predators don’t exist.
As if you didn’t build your entire lifestyle on denial.
We made it our life’s quest to inform the public about outrageous behavior — because you clearly can’t handle reality without supervision.	
Stay safe. Stay vigilant. Stay monitored.
