The Idea
Enlightment Nobles, Demarchy for the enlightend, Servanthood but choose of allegiance for those not noble

<The Sentence>
For the crimes against my people,
i sentence these conspirators to die,
in the flames of change.
The verdict is to be executed immediatly.
There will be  no appeal.
Any last words by the accused?

"It was necessary, for the good of all mankind, 
to limit some people, to hold them back,
 to prevent exponential gadgetrys - while we cant even handle the tech we got.
Was it evil, yes, but a necessary evil.
The millions of tomorrow - who will be alive, due to us taking action will vindicate use.
History will proof us right."
