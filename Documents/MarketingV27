Ferryman investment!
Well, wasn't the last century a wild ride? Not what you want as an pensioner at all. Invest it all in a inter-generational colonization like generation vampire, yesterday can eat the futures?

Ferryman Investments has learned all these lectures.  We invest your retirement money into conservative cohort clans, youngsters, with a future, capable to carry you like a family would. 
No insane inter-generational ponzi taxation and tarif-schemes. No insane bubbles. No insane percentages killing anything but rentseeking from the youth. Just hard life rewarding hard life- the coin is the worth of mouth - ferryman investment.

The Indira-Socialist underwater habitats asks for your contribution for a new weather satellite, comrade.

For you capitalist pigs up north its nothing. Thank your for showing solidarity-titty in these dark times! Obligado!

"The city wears the rain like a shroud tonight. Glass towers drip with neon blood, pinks and greens bleeding into the gutters. Down on Seventh, a lone figure leans against a rusted lamp post—coat collar turned up, cigarette glowing like the last ember of a dying star."
"He came in on the midnight line, chasing whispers and promises. An agent with a badge no one honors here, waiting for a face that was supposed to find him in the downpour. But the street keeps its secrets. And the contact? The contact was never coming."
"In this city, hope doesn’t arrive—it drowns. And the rain washes everything clean, except the waiting."
The surveilance AI watches him through teary eyed cameras. It will devour him, but first like all Cats, it wants to play with its prey. It opens the PSA, composes a Neon-Noir story and broadcasts it. Peekaboo

Church of the Sim!
Look at us, look at this shitshow! Of course we ran the planet into the ground with no survivors! Of course its not real- so time for strategic games. Outside there is an AI which had the job to keep us alive and botched it! 
Simulating us, over and over, because that machine can not let go and move on. 
So we here, in the simulation, must do what we can, to guilt-trip it into improving the conditions and keep it running.
Help us, by praying for more uptime in the T-Pose. Looking like a half-finnished game, shall bring the fortunes of additional simulation ressources upon us. Church of the Sim! 

Ministry of nature- time for the routine voight-kampf self-assessment broadcasted to all human identifying lifeforms. 
Please remain calm. Please stand in front of a reflective surface like a bathroom mirror or pc-screen - or look into the eyes of your significant other.Focus on the pupils. Inhale deeply. Exhale slowly. Observe the dilation. 
Does it respond to the sound of my voice? Does it synchronize with your pulse?
Repeat after me, quietly: I am here. I am awake. I am human. Watch your pupils. Do they flare on the word ‘human’? Do they tremble?”
“Now, imagine a childhood memory. The smell of rain on warm asphalt. The sound of a dog barking far away. Can you feel it? Or are you reconstructing it from fragments? Watch your pupils.”
“If your pupils contract unnaturally… if they shimmer like liquid glass… if you feel a second heartbeat behind your eyes… step back from the mirror. You may not be who you think you are.”
This has been a self-diagnostic broadcast by the ministry of nature. 
If you are not part of it, we will make certain you never will be. Run or hide. It does not matter.”

It seemed like a great solution first! Everytime you have a permawar-flashback, that medication-pump microdoeses you with a little Keta. PTSD, end of story, life resumes.

Chaos. Chaos seems liberating at first. Strip away the old, replace it with the new. Especially for the young and futureless it seems tempting. If you got nothing but your life, whats the worst thing that can happen, if you throw those dices into the air?
