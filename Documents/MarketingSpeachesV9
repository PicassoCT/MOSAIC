Rebellious Daydream - Cortex
Serving a mega-coooperation aint not joke. No freedom, no way to express your rage, except through more work.
And thanks to neural implants and drug requirements, there is no escape. But now there is.
Rebellious Daydream, the implant by cortex. While the rest of you slaves away your frontal lobe can escape into
a little powertrip fantasy. Form a punk band, run amok, step on tokyo as godzilla. Get parts of your life back while the rest of you does all the ring moves, says all the right things - and get paid while doing all the right things.


Crunchy! Delicous! You will never get enough! Dr.Diabetus dark chocolade, toes. 
The cereal killer! With that extra cremy filling and that chochlat crust you lust for.
Eat them with milk! Dry from a bowl! From the floor! They literally go together with anything.
Anywhere where food is sold, you can get your hands on: Dr.Diabetus Cereal, dark toes.
And now, you can get them cheaper in Sets! The cereal and the milk, fresh from the cow-tank.
