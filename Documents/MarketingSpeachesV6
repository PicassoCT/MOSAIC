It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood,
A beautiful day for a neighbor.
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?

But now we see, there's so much more to do.
Together we'll build, together we'll renew.
So let's unite, let's raise our voices high,
For the people, we'll strive, and we'll never say die.

It's a powerful day in this neighborhood,
A powerful day for a change.
Will you join me?
Will you stand with me?

I have always wanted to have a comrad just like you.
I've always wanted to live in a comune with you.

We've always wanted a community that's fair,
Where everyone has enough and there's kindness everywhere.

So, let's make the most of this beautiful day.
Since we're together, we might as well say:
Will you rise? Will you fight?
Won't you join the cause tonight?

Won't you please,
Won't you please?
Please join us and fight for our rights.
Sendero Revolutionary cells- humanity will not go quietly into the night.
Howl, scream, fight against the dying light.
