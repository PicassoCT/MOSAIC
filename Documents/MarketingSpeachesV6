We can help you- and create a healthy-alternative, that sits on the shelves like stones calming the public feng-shui with a choice.
Nothing sedates like responsibility distributed and societal agency diluted. The consumers are returning, the free market is healing. AliBuy products. We make it in red, so you don't have to.

Decomplexification is a crime. Simpler societies can not supply large numbers of people, thus calling for them,
is a call to a genocide by economics of any ideology in power. Report groups that agitate against:
Automated agriculture, investments, self-surveilance or hyperintelligencia. Regressing is a crime, giving in to Loopdeformationwhorship and fantasys of a golden past has murdered millions. Remember Cambodia, remember Sri Lanka. Your instincts are not a god, no matter how good and right they feel. The world sees and judges you.

It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood,
A beautiful day for a neighbor.
Would you be mine? Could you be mine?
It's a powerful day in this neighborhood,
A powerful day for a cause.
Will you join mine?
I have always wanted to have a brother in arms just like you.
I've always wanted to build a better world with you.
So, let's make the most of this last, beautiful night.
Since we're together, we might as well fight:
Rogersendero Revolutionary cells- humanity will not go quietly into the night.
Howl, scream, fight against the dying light.

Everything ever worth reading was written in the Pre-Collapse internet. Why not become a archive-archeologist - digging for the golden past? Exhume it, get it back running, bring it all back, perfectly fine software, books, games, our decadent ancestors abandoned and threw away to write off as rust. You too can help, rediscovering a past that worked better, untainted by AI, not yet riddled with Add-HD-Adds, when developers still had to be competent and companies still competed. Meet hot dig-site-teams near you- now. Join Past-Querries-Quary Inc. Can we dig it, yes we can!

Your societies justicesystem has collapsed, or is so hollowed out beyon repair? Join the Umar-Templar. We deal out good old justice and protect the innocent. You kidnapp them, drag them to our temple, we connect them via splice implant directly to the afterlife that awaits them. 10.000 subjective years of torture in hell, meeting those that dragged them down writhing in agony, reform even the hardest gangster. The only prison with zero relapses and zero prisoners. Get away with that.

Join the Umar-Templar. We collect the Original sin of the gilded past from the air, and burry it in pillars of green in the ocean.
We build automation, that plants heat resistant plants in the bulb-belt and cools the fever of our dying world. We hunt sinners against the 
book of creation and crucify there sense with implants. He who worship all consuming moloch be our enemy.
Print glass-trees into the dessert, to nurish and cool the life that has no hold. The future will be ours, we just have to plant it and guard it.
