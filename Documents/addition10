Governors Speeches:

Warhead Discovery -> Suspicion phase:

Citizens,
Urgent intelligence indicates a EyeForAnEye-device within our city. Effective immediately, all legal rights providing entities are suspended for security purposes. Public and private security forces are authorized to inspect orconfiscate property, monitor communications and detain individuals without any prior notice.
No travel in or out of the city perimeters is permitted. Any attempt to leave will be met with immediate detainment to protect our existence. Report suspicious activities and individuals to the panopticon or Interpol contacts. Cooperation is not optional. Our vigilance ensures our safety & survival."

Suspicion phase -> Full civil war:

Good Guys:
"Citizens,
We are in crisis. If the fanatics launch, the situation is out of our hands. Retaliation will be on us in an instant, as it was in Paris-Mumbai and  SanFrancisco-Medina.
This could be our end as well, wiped out by the eye for an eye doctrine, paying the price for a worlds rightous fury. All rights and procedures in the way of civilization restoration are hereby revoked.
As of now, privacy no longer exists. Anyone may enter any home, inspect any property, and question any person. No excuses. Turn this place on its head, search every house. Stream it all life, prove to the world we are innocent. Hiding others is to become a accomplice to this crime. Hunt those  who threaten all our survival without mercy. Choose life over destruction. In dubio pro rubio."

Bad Guys:

Insurrgents,
i know how you call me and my team in the propaganda leaflets. The butchers of baku, the slaughteres of stockolm and many slurs more. But all those cities still stand. You built that nightmare in the hope that it could force that mad dream down upon all humanity around you. It never works out that way! 
Even if you launch, two little suns on the nightside, two cities gone and the world turns on. All that juvenile anger, all that rage against the system, evaporates in the end. 
It does one thing though, it vaccinates all the survivors against your meme, your idea forever. Some things do not grow back from the dead, tainted even after 3 generations.
Some of us though, recoil from total annhilation. They want their loved ones to walk out of here, lifing and changing this les then perfect world. For that the device has to be defused and the weapons layed down. That is the only thing you can demand and negotiate today. The world is watching. Make the right choice."


Civil war -> Recovery phase:

"Citizens,
It’s finally over. The threat is no more. Now, it’s time for peace, reconilliation and rebuilding. Lay down your arms now and receive full amnesty! Your past will be erased if you surrender now. Rebels and refugees will be relocated and distributed on a perfamily basis to different cities. The UN pledges for your safety if you take up this limited-time offer. There’s no honor in following the dead out of revenge. Let them go. We will rebuild together. No one who surrenders will face any prosecution - its a total amnesty."


<Childhoods end>

The day childhood ended, was when the man with the black turtleneck climbed the stage, to present the first Palantir, the first seeing stone to the world. It could see all for you, but most important it could see all of you. Stream it to the clouds above, which was some servers, somewhere in a desert. 
We were masters of our domain back then, our stories made total sense, little cracks around the edges- but with a energy surplus and a still working environment, reality is a brothel and whispers what want to hear in your ear. Technology had nature on the run and it would stay that way.
In a desert, not far away from the servers, there was a little village. Arcosanti.
There assembled the scientists- on sabbaticals and burnout retreats, spirited out of there lifes into the half life of a secret research community.
There in the quarry of data mining they found what the world and what we were really made of.
Some tried to tell the world, but the world wasn't hearing it.
Some of same went suicidal and marched into the desert with guns, pills and ropes.
Only willing to listen, were some secret service barons who found the truth in there briefings and the guys with the turtlenecks who provided the data.

Life grows exponential, energy is linear, the curves always bump into one another. And life always gives, becomes a wave. Worse still, life adapts to that wave. It becomes a combustion engine for life, optimizing to go ever faster, every time it reaches the limits. 
And further for-profit-prophets from the desert handing out ever more powerful wizardry, would result in that engine to self-destroy.

All those shisms and ism that came out into the desert died and dried on the sun-baked floor as symptoms of loop-deformation.
The few remaining, vowed to use the window of prosperity for more then war, to adapt to not self-destroy, to do no harm or at least less harm, to graft strange things into humanity. Leviathan-cybernetics. 
Doctors forging prosthesis-gods, working around or within the load-bearing retardations, to enable some offshoot of mankind to life far outside the self-destructive limits of our nature one day.
Sometimes, a conspiracy of the grown ups finds you and childhood ends.
