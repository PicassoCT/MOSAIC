Governors Speeches:

Warhead Discovery -> Suspicion phase:

Citizens,
Urgent intelligence indicates  with high likelihood a EyeForAnEye-device within our city. Effective immediately, all legal rights providing entities are temporarily suspended for security purposes. Public and private security forces are authorized to inspect property, monitor communications, and detain individuals without any prior notice.
No travel in or out of the city perimeters is permitted. Any attempt to leave will be met with immediate detainment to protect our existence. Report suspicious activities and individuals to the panopticon or Interpol contacts. Cooperation is not optional. Your vigilance ensures our safety."

Suspicion phase -> Full civil war:

Good Guys:
"Citizens,
We are in crisis. If the fanatics launch, the situation is out of our hands, retaliation will be devastating—remember Paris, remember Mumbai.
This could be our end as well, the eye for an eye doctrine, wiping us out paying the price for their fury.
Privacy no longer exists. Anyone may enter any home, inspect any property, and question any person. No excuses. Turn this place on its head.
Turn on your devices, stream your lives—prove to the world we are innocent. Hiding others is complicity to the crime.
Those who threaten our survival will be hunted without mercy. Choose survival over destruction."

Bad Guys:

Insurrgents,
you who got the device, abandon all hopes of an outcome that could be called victory. The weapon exists, and if launched, it will bring destruction beyond comprehension on us and them. There’s no escaping that truth. You’re angry at the system, at us, at the world. But this rage will not save you or your idea. Is revenge worth the annihilation of everything? You might believe there’s a way out—some deal to be made. There isn’t. The only choice left is to stop this before it’s too late. We know it feels hopeless. The city is crumbling, and your ideals are crumbling with it. But even now, there’s a future to fight for—if you let go. This is reality. If you continue, it’s over. But you can still choose survival. Stand down, and no more lives need be lost.
The world is watching. Make the right choice."

Civil war -> Recovery phase:

"Citizens,
It’s over. The threat is gone. Now, it’s time for peace and rebuilding. Lay down your arms now and receive full amnesty! Your past will be erased if you surrender now. Rebels and refugees will be relocated to a new city, split by families for security. The UN pledges for your safety if you take up this limited-time offer. There’s no honor in holding others hostage. Let them go. We will rebuild together. No one who surrenders will face prosecution. This is our last chance to move forward."

Recovery phase -> Normal gameplay:
<exhausted speech excerpt>

On that last day of summer, the child embarked on the project to climb the highest tree on the grounds.
We who gorged on the smashed fruit below like wasps, shaken down in previous attempts, cheered it on for ever more.
And so began the climb, all over the worlds, all of life has starred at this, hypnotized by rewards, ability-branch for ability.
This one doomed project, this one hope to stay unchanged in the sunshine, that gets all intelligence into the ground one way or another.
Some triumphant victory leap and within a jubilant final yell we learn all worth knowing about the fall.
And it all goes so wrong, so slow, so fast. The thin, last branch gives, and we all started falling to a surprised scream. 
The soaring of air, of leaves swishing by. All we can do now, is manage the downward trajectory, towards the hard rocks beneath. Twist that way, throw branches together, sap energy to slow down, take that trade off injury instead of certain death. Twist around that branch, so one day, after a long mend, we might climb again. The climb has given us miracles, which we used to avoid changing. We would fly unaltered like Icarus on singularity wings!
The fall taught us about the value of small mercies, but it has yet to change the nature of the tree and the ground.
We all have seen too many horrors now, regional nuclear exchanges between wet bulbed ghost-cities. 
Our beloved and brightest ones dissolving in destructive information, walking out of the firelightcycle to become ever stranger things, never to return. We yanked our hearts out to stay a sentient and civil during this crises. 
Keeping calm and carrying on, ever fewer, ever onwards. To save our souls from that final dark smash at the roots of that tree. 
We jammed technology into our heads, were the ink on the patents had not dried yet, all to survive and thrive none the less.
Thank you for breathing lightly, as we lay with smashed limbs on flimsy branches, listening for stability.
Thank you for staying sane and not going feral - a human among humans - even when states fail.
Thank you for not growing cancerous, trying to make infinite copies in a race to the bottom.
The world of tomorrow sees and is grateful for our sacrifices today.
