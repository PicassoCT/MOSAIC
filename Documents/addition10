On that last day of summer, when the wasps swarm the smashed pears, to stave of the cold, it was that
 our only, beloved child embarked on the project, to climb the highest tree on the grounds.
It had planned for it, all summer long and we encouraged and nodded along, idiotic, stunned fools that we were.
And as we watched, branch by branch, tool by tool, the deja vu finally came back to us.
We have been here before, this one, doomed project that is our only hope as a species, 
is what gets every intelligence into this wheel chair one summers end.
Some triumphant laughter, one victory yell later and for one panicy telepathic seoond we regained it all during the fall.
But its to late, the final thin, branch gives, one last yell of desperation, the soaring of air, leaves swishing by, it all goes so fast and yet so slow. All we can do now, is manage the downfall, towards the hard rocks beneath. Twist that way, throw branches together, to slow down, take that trade off injury instead of certain death. The climb has given us miracles, but it did not change the nature of the tree, the ground or the child. We did not grow wings up there in the highest branches, no matter how close we thought ourselves to the singularity in the sky.
The fall had many horrors, regional nuclear exchange, strange constructs, some us being a wulf to one another.
The realization of our limitations, has broken our wings, our spirits.
Full situational awareness of ourselves revealed itself to be destructive information. That living with the awareness of the fall, terrorizes us all.
Regional nuclear exchanges, strange constructs, we have ripped our hearts out to stay a sentient and civil species during crisis.
To save our soul from that final dark smash at the roots that tree. Thank you for staying sane, non-feral, a human among humans.
Thank you for keeping calm and carrying on, even after all that happened. Thank you for not growing cancerous, trying to become more at all cost.
The world of tomorrow sees and is grateful for our sacrifices today.
