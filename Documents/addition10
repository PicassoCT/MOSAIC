Warhead Discovery -> Suspicion phase:

Citizens,
Urgent intelligence indicates a high likelihood of a WMD-device presence within our city. Effective immediately, all legal rights providing entities are temporarily suspended for security purposes. Public and private security forces are authorized to inspect property, monitor communications, and detain individuals without any prior notice.
No travel in or out of the city perimeters is permitted. Any attempt to leave will be met with immediate detainment to protect our existence.
Report suspicious activities or individuals to the panopticon or the Interpol contacts. Cooperation is not optional. Your vigilance ensures our safety."

Suspicion phase -> Full civil war:
Good Guys:
"Citizens,
We are in crisis. If the fanatics launch, the situation is out of our hands, retaliation will be devastating—remember Paris, remember Mumbai.
This could be our end as well, the eye for an eye doctrine, wiping us out paying the price for their fury.
Privacy no longer exists. Anyone may enter any home, inspect any property, and question any person. No excuses. Turn this place on its head.
Turn on your devices, stream your lives—prove to the world we are innocent. Hiding others is complicity to the crime.
Those who threaten our survival will be hunted without mercy. Choose survival over destruction."

Bad Guys:

Insurrgentleman,  (Neologismalarm)
you may think this isn’t real—that this is just another empty threat. But the weapon exists, and if launched, it will bring destruction beyond comprehension. There’s no escaping that truth. You’re angry at the system, at us, at the world. But this rage will not save you, nor your loved ones. Is revenge worth the annihilation of everything? You might believe there’s a way out—some deal to be made. There isn’t. The only choice left is to stop this before it’s too late. We know it feels hopeless. The city is crumbling, and your ideals are crumbling with it. But even now, there’s a future to fight for—if you let go. This is reality. If you continue, it’s over. But you can still choose survival. Stand down, and no more lives need be lost.
The world is watching. Make the right choice."

Civil war -> Recovery phase:

"Citizens,
It’s over. The threat is gone. Now, it’s time for peace and rebuilding. Lay down your arms and receive full amnesty—your past will be erased if you surrender now. Rebels and refugees will be relocated to a new city, with families split for security. This is a limited-time offer—there’s no honor in holding others hostage. Let them go. We will rebuild together. The UN is here to help, and no one who surrenders will face prosecution. This is your last chance to move forward."

Recovery phase -> Norma gameplay:

On that last day of summer, our only, beloved child embarked on the project, to climb the highest tree on the grounds.
It had planned for it, all summer long and we fools cheered it on, hypnotized by the prospects like wasp in smashed fruit.
And as we watched, branch by branch, tool by tool, the déjà vu brought us fully awake for the first time. Allover the worlds, all of life has been here before, below this doomed project. Our only hope to stay unaltered as a species, is what gets all intelligences into the wheel chair eventually.
Some triumphant victory laughter later and within one panicy telepathic moment we know everything there is to know about the fall.
And it all goes so slow, wrong, so fast, the thin, last branch giving, the late suprised scream. The soaring of air, leaves swishing by.
All we can do now, is manage the downfall, towards the hard rocks beneath. Twist that way, throw branches together, to slow down, take that trade off injury instead of certain death, spare that branch, so one day, after a long mend, we might climb again.
The climb has given us miracles, which we used to avoid knowing about the end. We would fly like icarus on singularity wings!
The fall taught us about the true value of small mercies and miracles. Neither did change the nature of the tree, the ground or ourselves.
We all have seen too many horrors, regional nuclear exchange, wet bulbed ghost-cities. Our beloved and brightest ones dissolving, walking out of the campfire cycle to change into strange things never to return. Even full awareness showed itself to be destructive, crippling information. We have ripped our hearts out to stay a sentient and civil species during crises. Keeping calm and carrying on, ever fewer, ever onwards. To save our souls from that final dark smash at listening, the roots of that tree. 
We jammed technology into our heads, were the ink on the patents had not dried yet, all to survive and thrive falling.
Thank you for breathing lightly, as we lay with smashed limbs on thin branches, listening for creaking stability, high above ground.
Thank you for staying sane and not going feral - a human among humans, even with no power monopoly at times.
Thank you for not growing cancerous, trying to make infinite copies at one another cost.
The worlds of tomorrow sees and will be grateful for our sacrifices today.
