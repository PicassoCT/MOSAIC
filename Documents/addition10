Governors Speeches on Recovery end:

On that last day of summer, our only, beloved child embarked on the project, to climb the highest tree on the grounds.
It had planned for it, all summer long and we optimistically cheered it on, hypnotized like wasps in smashed fruit in first freeze
And as we watched, branch by branch, tool by tool,from below, the dejavu came back to us. We have been here before, all of life below this one, doomed project, this endless summers end. Our only hope to stay unaltered as a species, is what gets all intelligence into the wheel chair eventually.
Some triumphant laughter, one victory yell later and within one panicy telepathic moment we regained all knowledge about fall.
But its to late, the final thin, branch gives, one last scream of desperation, the soaring of air, leaves swishing by, it all goes by so fast and yet so slow. 
All we can do now, is manage the downfall, towards the hard rocks beneath. Twist that way, throw branches together, to slow down, take that trade off injury instead of certain death, protect that branch, so one day, after we mend, we might climb again.
The climb has given us miracles, which we used to avoid knowing our limitations. We thought we would fly incaruslike towards the sky on singularities wings!
The fall has tought us about the true small mercies and miracles. Neither did change the nature of the tree, the ground or the child.
We all have seen to many horrors, regional nuclear exchange, wetbulbed cities and our beloved ones dissolved into strange things that promised to put an end to horrors. 
Full awareness itself, showed itself to be destructive information stunting us all in terror.
We have ripped our hearts out to stay a sentient and civil species during crisis. Keeping calm and carrying on, ever fewer, ever onwards.
To save our soul from that final dark smash at the roots that tree. 
Thank you for staying sane, non-feral, a human among humans. For breathing lightly, as we lay with smashed limbs on thin branches, listening for stability.
Thank you for doing so, even with no governments and no company there to hold down a power monopoly.
So many of our best and brightest, ventured outside the circle of the last fire, promising an end to the doom, never to return. Thank you for staying awake, alert and grounded. Thank you for not growing cancerous, trying to make infinite copies  at cost of all others.
The world of tomorrow sees and is grateful for our sacrifices today.
