Governors Speeches:

Warhead Discovery -> Suspicion phase:

Citizens,
Urgent intelligence indicates a EyeForAnEye-device within this district. Effective immediately, all legal rights providing entities are suspended until further notice. Public and private security forces are authorized to inspect and confiscate any property, monitor all communications and detain individuals indefinitely.
During the emergency, no travel in or out of the cities perimeters is permitted. Any attempt to leave will be met with rigorous violence by the deployed situation containment forces. This state will last Report suspicious activities and individuals to the panopticon. Demand to see, demand to know. Our vigilance ensures our safety & survival."

Suspicion phase -> Full civil war:

Towards Good Guys:
"Citizens,
if the fanatics launch, the situation is forever out of our hands, retaliation will be swift and devastating. Remember: Paris-Mumbai and Palo Alto with Mekka, a city for a city. This would be our end as well, wiped out by deterrence, paying the price for a worlds fury.
As of now, going forward privacy no longer exists. 
Anyone may enter and search any home, inspect any data and question any person. 
No excuses. Turn this place on its head, every house, every cellar.
Turn on your devices, show and stream all of life, prove to the world we are innocent. 
Hiding "persecuted" others is to be a accomplice to theire crime.
Hunt those  who threaten our survival without mercy. 
Choose life!"

Towards Bad Guys:
"Insurrgents,
you know us as the butchers of bakku, the medina-muderers, the kopenhage-killers. But all those cities still life, still have lights on at night, still stand. As does my team and our will to end this crisis.
You built it in the hope that mutual assured destruction could force that mad fever dream of an idelology upon all of humanity around you. It never works out like that! Even if you launch, two little suns on earths nightside, two cities gone and the world just turns on. All that juvenile anger, all that rage against the system, accomplishes nothing in the end. 
It does one thing though, it vaccinates all future survivors against your god, your cult, your great idea and plan. Forever. Some ideas do not grow back from a horror, even after 3 generations. Some of us though, recoil from total annhilation. They want their loved ones to walk away and actually change the world.
For that, we have to life, for that the device has to be defused. 
That is the only thing you can demand and negotiate over with me. 
The world is watching. Make the right choice."


Civil war -> Recovery phase:

"Citizens,
It’s done. The nightmare is over, its builders are gone. It’s time to clean up the mess, to rebuild for peace. Turn over a fresh sheet. To those still fighting, lay down your arms now and receive full amnesty! Your past will be invisible, even to us, if you surrender now. 
Rebels and refugees alike will be relocated and distributed on a per-family basis to different cities on different continents. 
The panopticon itself pledges for neutrality and safety if you take up this offer. 
There’s no honor in holding on to revenge, when offered such a golden bridge out of at least a warcrime. Then again, there are those on both sides, who want tabula rasa.
Pushing for a clean slate, to sterilize the petri dish, an atrocity for an attrocity, now, tomorrow forever. Please dont make us do this.


<Childhoods end>

The day childhood ended, was when the man with the black turtleneck climbed the stage, to present the first Palantir, the first all seeing smart stone to yet another world. It could see all of you. Stream it to the clouds above, which was some servers, somewhere in a desert. 
We were masters of our domain back then, our stories made total sense, little cracks around the edges- but with a energy surplus and a still working environment, reality is a brothel and whispers what want to hear in your ear. Technology had nature on the run and it would stay that way.
In a desert, not far away from the servers, there was a little village. Arcosanti.
There assembled the scientists- on sabbaticals and burnout retreats, spirited out of there lifes into the half life of a secret research community.
There in the quarry of data mining they found what the world and what we were really made of.
Some tried to tell the world, but the world wasn't hearing it.
Some of same went suicidal and marched into the desert with guns, pills and ropes.
Only willing to listen, were some secret service barons who found the truth in there briefings and the guys with the turtlenecks who provided the data.

Life grows exponential, energy is linear, the curves always bump into one another. And life always gives, becomes a wave. Worse still, life adapts to that wave. It becomes a combustion engine for life, optimizing to go ever faster, every time it reaches the limits. 
And further for-profit-prophets from the desert handing out ever more powerful wizardry, would result in that engine to self-destroy.

All those shisms and ism that came out into the desert died and dried on the sun-baked floor as symptoms of loop-deformation.
The few remaining, vowed to use the window of prosperity for more then war, to adapt to not self-destroy, to do no harm or at least less harm, to graft strange things into humanity. Leviathan-cybernetics. 
Doctors forging prosthesis-gods, working around or within the load-bearing retardations, to enable some offshoot of mankind to life far outside the self-destructive limits of our nature one day.
Sometimes, a conspiracy of the grown ups finds you and childhood ends.
