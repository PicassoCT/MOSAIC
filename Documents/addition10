Governors Speeches:

Warhead Discovery -> Suspicion phase:

Citizens,
Urgent intelligence indicates a EyeForAnEye-device within our city. Effective immediately, all legal rights providing entities are suspended for security purposes. Public and private security forces are authorized to inspect orconfiscate property, monitor communications and detain individuals without any prior notice.
No travel in or out of the city perimeters is permitted. Any attempt to leave will be met with immediate detainment to protect our existence. Report suspicious activities and individuals to the panopticon or Interpol contacts. Cooperation is not optional. Our vigilance ensures our safety & survival."

Suspicion phase -> Full civil war:

Good Guys:
"Citizens,
We are in crisis. If the fanatics launch, the situation is out of our hands, retaliation will be devastating—remember Paris-Mumbai, SanFrancisco and Mekka.
This could be our end as well, wiped out by the eye for an eye doctrine, paying the price for the worlds fury.
As of now, privacy no longer exists. Anyone may enter any home, inspect any property, and question any person. No excuses. Turn this place on its head, every house, every cellar.
Turn on your devices, stream all of it life, prove to the world we are innocent. 
Hiding "persecuted" others is to be a accomplice to theire crime.
Hunt those  who threaten our survival without mercy. Choose life over destruction."

Bad Guys:

Insurrgents,
you who got the device, abandon all hopes of an outcome that could be called victory. Your weapon existing and  launched, will bring destruction beyond comprehension on all of who supported you. There’s no escaping that truth. You’re angry at the system, at the world. But this rage will not save you or your idea. Is it really worth the annihilation of itself? You might believe there’s a way out—some deal to be made. There isn’t. The only choice left is to stop this before it’s final. It might feel hopless, like defeat, the city is crumbling, and your ideals are crumbling with it. But even now, there’s a future worth to life for—if you let go. This is reality. If you continue, it’s over. But you can still choose differently. Stand down, and no more lives need be lost.
The world is watching. Make the right choice."


Civil war -> Recovery phase:

"Citizens,
It’s finally over. The threat is gone. Now, it’s time for peace, reconilliation and rebuilding. Lay down your arms now and receive full amnesty! Your past will be erased if you surrender now. Rebels and refugees will be relocated on a perfamily basis to new cities. The UN pledges for our safety if you take up this limited-time offer. There’s no honor in holding others hostage. Let them go. We will rebuild together. No one who surrenders will face prosecution. This is our last chance to move forward."

Recovery phase -> Normal gameplay:

<Childhoods end>

The day childhood ended, was when the man with the black turtleneck climbed the stage, to present the first Palantir, the first seeing stone to the world. It could see all for you, but most important it could see all of you. Stream it to the clouds above, which was some servers, somewhere in a desert. 
We were masters of our domain back then, our stories made total sense, little cracks around the edges- but with a energy surplus and a still working environment, reality is a brothel and whispers what want to hear in your ear. Technology had nature on the run and it would stay that way.
In a desert, not far away from the servers, there was a little village. Arcosanti.
There assembled the scientists- on sabbaticals and burnout retreats, spirited out of there lifes into the half life of a secret research community.
There in the quarry of data mining they found what the world and what we were really made of.
Some tried to tell the world, but the world wasn't hearing it.
Some of same went suicidal and marched into the desert with guns, pills and ropes.
Only willing to listen, were some secret service barons who found the truth in there briefings and the guys with the turtlenecks who provided the data.

Life grows exponential, energy is linear, the curves always bump into one another. And life always gives, becomes a wave. Worse still, life adapts to that wave. It becomes a combustion engine for life, optimizing to go ever faster, every time it reaches the limits. 
And further for-profit-prophets from the desert handing out ever more powerful wizardry, would result in that engine to self-destroy.

All those shisms and ism that came out into the desert died and dried on the sun-baked floor as symptoms of loop-deformation.
The few remaining, vowed to use the window of prosperity for more then war, to adapt to not self-destroy, to do no harm or at least less harm, to graft strange things into humanity. Leviathan-cybernetics. 
Doctors forging prosthesis-gods, working around or within the load-bearing retardations, to enable some offshoot of mankind to life far outside the self-destructive limits of our nature one day.
Sometimes, a conspiracy of the grown ups finds you and childhood ends.
