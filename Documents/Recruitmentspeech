"I know you want your family flown out. We can organize that, but first we need your help.."
"You know what your brother got himself into? Do you want to help him, before its to late?"
"There are no good guys out there. Just Hasbeens and Wannabe empires stepping over people. Order is a good worth protecting.."

"For a 100 years, we just had to take it. Hit in the face, again and again. This is our chance to be left alone ever after.."
"Your whole family was in <noise>..  and now they are here. Bribing there way in.. I know what i would want.."
"Look at what they turned the world into, the smoking ruin.. We could life like kings, if they had not strangled science.."
"Yeah, there you are, the back hurts from all the work- and what do you got to show for it? Nothing. Its payback time.. "
"Do you have a minute to talk about your personal lord and saviour, Elon?"
"They collected all our cellphone data, and learned how to manipulate us perfectly. And this is the world they made.."
