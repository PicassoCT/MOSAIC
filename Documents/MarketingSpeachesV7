MOSAIC components have a bad rep. Lego of Death. Terrorist-bricks.
But have you considered the civilian applications? Your company too, can have
drones, robots and machinery, assembled by automatic plattforms, with dirt cheap, standardized components.
Rugged, reliable, tested and proven a million times over. Thousands of AIs, roll out
prototype itterations every day, stacked and packed together from MOSAIC components.
And it all fits, the connections, the interfaces, the software components.
There is a reason the world switched in lockstep to this standard.
Contract the idea to an Engineering AI at sunrise, have the finale product at dawn.
