MOSAIC components have a bad rep. Lego of Death. Terrorist-bricks.
But have you considered the civilian applications? Your company too, can have
drones, robots and machinery, assembled by automatic plattforms, with dirt cheap, standardized components on the spot - minus the explosives.
Rugged, reliable, tested and proven a million times over. Thousands of AIs, roll out
machine-prototype itterations every day, stacked and packed together from MOSAIC components.
And it all fits, the connections, the interfaces, the software components. 
Mass-produced components even beat 3d printing when it comes to price. 
There is a reason the worlds security switched in lockstep to this.
Subcontract the idea to an engineering AI at sunrise, have the finale product at dawn.
MOSAIC- a darpa standard. The future is build of it.
