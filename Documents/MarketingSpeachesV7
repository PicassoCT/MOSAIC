MOSAIC components have a bad rep. Lego of Death. Terrorist-bricks.
But have you considered the civilian applications? Your company too, can have
drones, robots and machinery, assembled by automatic plattforms, with dirt cheap, standardized components on the spot - minus the explosives.
Rugged, reliable, tested and proven a million times over. Thousands of AIs, roll out
machine-prototype itterations every day, stacked and packed together from MOSAIC components.
And it all fits, the connections, the interfaces, the software components. 
Mass-produced components even beat 3d printing when it comes to price. 
There is a reason the worlds security switched in lockstep to this.
Subcontract the idea to an engineering AI at sunrise, have the finale product at dawn.
MOSAIC- a darpa standard. The future is build of it.

When Hiveminds die because the implants give way, insanity sets in, or there enemies win. 
Barely able to speak, barely able to eat, deep in post-coalescence psychosis, the pieces aka godshards

We try to restore the original personality and reward you handsomely for all information extracted along the way.
Zero risk of hivemind memory reformation and revenge. St. Diikstra NGO.

History has been extensively rewritten in the past, often with political goals, sometimes just out of neglicence.
Help the enlightenment, to record a full version, by giving testimony, to historic events, catastrophees or warcrimes,
directly to the blockchain. And its a public ledger, so they can not remove a thing.
Write the truth in stone, write theire names down, where no government can ever delete them.
