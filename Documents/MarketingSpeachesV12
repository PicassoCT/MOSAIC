You can say a lot about suicidal maniacs and madman! But you can't say they weren't honest.
We all have to eat closed loop greenhouse vegetables, because our ancestors wouldn't listen. 
Reality was what you wanted it to be, ground-truth be damned. And why couldn't it be? 
There was enough of everything, so that parallel truths could coexist peacefully forever or so they thought.
There where plenty of plot-holes, plenty of giveaways, but they doubled down - 
and we get to hear that bets half-life every shopping trip with the Geiger. 
The panopticon is not some foreign power, some invader out to subjugate you.
The panopticon is not the state, nor some company or some AI listening in. 
The panopticon is you, needs you - to listen. 
To really listen to the madman. It needs you to take him serious when he is giving the game away. 
We have teams for that sort of madness now, if detected early. 
The panopticon is nothing without your vigilance.
Its to late to fix the madness of our ancestors.
