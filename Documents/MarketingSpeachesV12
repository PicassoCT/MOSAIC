You can say a lot about suicidal maniacs and madman! But you can't say they weren't honest.
We all have to eat closed loop greenhouse vegetables, because our ancestors wouldn't listen. 
Reality was what you wanted it to be, ground-truth be damned. And why couldn't it be? 
There was enough of everything, so that parallel truths could coexist peacefully forever or so they thought.
There where plenty of plot-holes, plenty of giveaways, but they doubled down - 
and we get to hear that bets half-life every shopping trip with the Geiger. 
The panopticon is not some foreign power, some invader out to subjugate you.
The panopticon is not the state, nor some company or some AI listening in. 
The panopticon is you, needs you - to listen. 
To really listen to the madman. It needs you to take him serious when he is giving the game away. 
We have teams for that sort of madness now, if detected early. 
The panopticon is nothing without your vigilance.
Its to late to fix the madness of our ancestors.

Throwing away the dead, is economic nonsense. A ton of medical products, cosmetics and
other daily used goods - are made from humans, a great source for proteins, fats and kreatin.
Many of us reject that - for religous reasons and we respect that. Which is why we got certified with 140 different religions, for a sould extraction ritual, leaving the body guaranteed 100% soulless.
It could all be expensive traditional, vatgrown box, composed, plant-nutrients, food.
Or you go full cycle and your relatives toast to your taxfree absence.
Who knows, tomorrow, whats left of you might smile from that lipsstick of your niece!
Tyler Burden Recycling.

We have virtual models of human biochemistry now- but people do not trust virtually tested products.
Which is why we still search for people who volunteer for controlled medical experiments.
Check in on time, get some mysterious injection, survive the 6 hour errection,
and we give you cold hard cash on top. Beats boiling trash to oil in some landfill.
