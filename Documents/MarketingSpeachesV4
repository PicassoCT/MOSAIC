Pinkerton Stalker Fanservice:
Stalking is taxing, time-consuming and tiresome. Why not pay us money and our company does it for you? We work for large cooperations and private persons. Who exactly? None of your buisness and that is our buisness. We get yout that bathwater, that frozzen shit, her hair or his sock - without getting you in trouble for your despair. We steal those panties, fresh, right out of the laundromat basket. No questions asked, you sick freak.
 
Everything falling apart at home? Why not glue it back together - with external threats? Wulfs circling the house, a lovecraftian newspaper, strangers harassing your life and wife. We create that horror ambiance, that ducttapes your dysfunctional social unit together one day more. 
So good, they made a life-tv from our longest running couple. #BunkerBertAndBertha
