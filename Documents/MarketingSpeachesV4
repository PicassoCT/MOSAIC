Pinkerton Stalker Fanservice:
Stalking is taxing, time-consuming and tiresome. Why not pay us money and our company does it for you? We stalk for large cooperations, and now any private person paying. Who exactly? None of your business and that is our business. We get you that bathwater, that frozen shit, her hair or his sock - without getting you in trouble for your despair. We steal those panties, fresh - out of the laundromat basket. No questions asked, you sick freak.
 
Everything falling apart at home? Why not glue it back together - with synthetic fear? You can have strangers circle your home like wolfs, a lovecraftian newsmedia and a wagon fort community. We create that horror ambiance, that ducttapes your dysfunctional social unit together for one more day.

A city is a challenging environment - and breeds only the smartest, big-eyed, cute critters. And now they all are to clever for their own good, roaming the backyards, quoting shakespeerpressure, selling drugs for hugs.
We exterminate feral hyper-dogs, animu-cats, boars, rabbitfoxes, pygmypandas, pzombiechildren and turing-thermites. 
No tears, no awws, just heartless, quiet and clean. Bugs Busters.

We all remember that one time, you got food poisoning, because they used gutter-oil in your favorite take-out. And its all fake, the recommendations, the social-network, the potemkin companies - they all sell out till you see five stars in some backyard privy. Never again with Cup-bearers Incooperated. We check out restaurants and products ahead of time, personally, with video proof of consumption at date. Eat fresh, or we fist there faces.

Lost family in the chaos? Dont know were your brother, sister, dad or mum ended up?  We find out, we dig, we bring closure. We reconnect the living and avenge the dead. Find that heirloom you lost and dive for that childhood home lost to the sea. If sold into slavery, we extract or at least help you get a fair share.
