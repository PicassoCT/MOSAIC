Pinkerton Stalker Fanservice:
Stalking is taxing, time-consuming and tiresome. Why not pay us money and our company does it for you? We stalk for large cooperations, and now any private person paying. Who exactly? Wesay nothing. None of your business and that is our business. We get you that bathwater, that frozen turd, her hair or his sock - without getting you in trouble. We steal those panties, fresh - out of the laundromat basket. No questions asked, you sick freak.
 
Everything falling apart at home? Why not glue it back together - with synthetic fear? You can have strangers circle your home like wolfs, a lovecraftian newsmedia and a wagon fort community. We create that horror ambiance, that ducttapes your dysfunctional social unit together for one more day.

A city is a challenging environment - and breeds only the smartest, big-eyed ever cuter critters. And now they are out there, roaming the backyards, quoting shakespeerpressure while selling drugs and hugs. Bugs Busters exterminates feral everpuppies, hellnokitties, pygmypandas, pzombiechildren, furryfoxes and 
turing-thermites. No Ooohs, no awws, no compassion, just screams and a return of quiet and green.

We check out restaurants and products ahead of time, personally, with video proof of consumption at date. Eat fresh or else..
