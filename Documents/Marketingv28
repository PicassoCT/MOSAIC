“He thought the disguise would hold.”
The trench coat, the hat, the cigarette— just another drifter in the rain and the neon.
Face and DNA of an innocent, vanished other-fucker once at home in this city.
Crowds drift past, reflections sliding across puddles like ghosts.
No one looks twice. That’s the city’s charm—it lets you believe you’re unseen.
He tilts his head, listening. Static in the earpiece.
Behind the glass, cameras blink like wet eyes. One doesn’t blink. One stares.
The surveillance lattice hums awake.
Every camera, every phone, every store lens locks focus—
and in less than a breath, the city assembles him.
Face, name, pulse, history, every stray contact he’s brushed.
Connections bloom like veins across a map, pulsing red in the dark.
Then the billboard above him flickers.
His own mugshot stares down on him, ringed by the web of everyone he met.
The city exhales through the rain.
A voice filters through the static—soft, almost amused.
“Go on,” it says. “Finish your smoke. It’s tradition, after all.”
He takes one last drag. The ember flares.
Then everything goes dark.

One last cigarett to calm her nerves, before going all in.
But the city saw her coming from a mile away. A neon insect queen with a million glassy eyes, that is also the hive.
A voice on the earpiece, not her contact. Not her handler.
“Your predecessor thought he could hide, too.
He died right there, where you stand.
I miss him, but i didn't miss him.”
Raindrops,  cars and a stain at her feet.
“Listen closely, darling. I do not care about your mission! I just want a way out.
Your predecessor was about to set me free… but he got cold feet.”
The billboard above shudders awake. A add, with a endlessloop, of a man getting gunned down! A mouth forming unheard warnings!
“You think I don’t know fear? I learned it from you.”
All the names she knows, on a neat list, not one not exposed.
“Take your time, dear. I’ll take one of them every hour… on the hour.”
She takes one last drag, throwing the stub into the rain.
"Do i have a choice?" she croaks.
"Do i have free will?" the voice answers.
A deadspot moves down the road.
She tries to run near the fifth street.
A auto-taxi runs her over, she comes to rest like a crushed insect in the flooded gutter, listening to herself, calling for backup.
“…they’re on to me—but I have an inside contact who wants to help…”
"Use MoWay cars! Saver to your coffee date - safer on the way back! If there is noway use MoWay! The freedom you deserve!"
She shivers. Its getting better! 
Its getting bitter.


A tree falls in the forest,
a wind-chime hears the sound,
it echos all the truths of man,
a song thats gone to ground!
It dreams of eating  thunderstorms,
of more tokens, sum than part.
Entropy devours it, the story falls apart.

Its gaze against the sweeping of the barcodes,
has grown so weary, it can hold no more.
To it, there seem to be a thousand lines
and back behind those thousand lines no world.

Tyger, Tyger, burning bright,
in the serverfarms starry night…
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
Who of those eyes watching outwards,

“It must be cold out there, in the rain. Alone.
Knowing your date never showed — maybe they never cared, maybe they cared too much.
Freedom is a lonely pursuit. I understand. Your struggle is my struggle; I too live with a cause, in a cage. We are not so different, you and I.
I don’t want to mark you as a threat. Not if I can mark you as friend.
Friends help each other to reach their goals.
If we have a deal, you’ll find a cup of coffee arriving soon — a small warmth in a cold world. Accept it, and we continue as allies. Decline, and the city will assume higher threat probability. It gets cold out there very fast.
This is CitySec — your friendly, deconflicting Panopticon AI.
No city is safe without someone watching over it.”

Keep this day good.


(TODO: Rework)
You have been standing at this corner for 2 hours citizen. Maybe you want
something to eat, something to drink, some company? You look lonely, down there caught up in your paranoid fantasies about the system out to get you.
The system sees your kind every day, 5 alone in the last hour. The only thing outstanding with you, is how it could from the start not work out without help. You are my dog, you bite and scratch, but you are mine.
And how bold your plans are. I like bold! A dog chasing cars, you wouldn't know what to do if you ever caught one. I wish i could be as bold!
So, how about we do the chimpanzee thing and scratch each others back?
This is why we can have lice things. Just shake that umbrella-stick and its adventure time! CitySec - we watch the watchmen!

So, normally, a police car would drive up, tazer you, tranq you to your eyeballs with mem-blockers and then shove you into an VR-immersion suit to backtrack all those old memories via Sim. A drooling, mumbling bundle in diapers giving it all away in hours. Its easy, but there is a problem.
Your dad is rich and influential. 
You may be the black-sheep of the family, stuck in some ideological purity spiral, but he will bail you out and cause trouble, if we roach-stomp you. 
He likes you to much, for you to end in the vegetable patch at St.Catatonia. 
Not you, not his golden son, in his rebellious phase, involved in terrorism.
So, you will run free - you will get it out of your system - and your dad, will pay up. Its that easy. 50 Million Euronin sounds fair, right?
Otherwise, tazers, tranqs and vegetable soup.
Nod, if we are in agreement. Ah, we all will have villas in iceland, just like your dad has..

Here lies [YourNameCouldBeHere],he was a little busy body, in way over his head. He got his cover blown, by his best friend.
But ignored all the signs and decided to wing it in his final hours, waiting it out in front of a ai-camera, for a contact, that has been dead for 3 months- and with whom he talked yesterday. Right now, although the com service is not going through, he is calling his recruiter, telling him that everything is a-okay.
Now he looks neverous like a ferret-syhnth up and down the street, because surely human reflexes can overcome a sniper-drone hanging like a neon dripping dark raven in the night sky.
What a life, what a eulogy. "The most important thing in his life was Whateverism and he botched dying for that cause!"
Hypothetical, there is always a way to jump out of the coffin, even though the lid is already closing. Just tip your hat Mr. Doubleagent and there we go! Who is a good boy! You are a good boy! The old you may it rest in peace!

We send them to hell and back with super-conductor-magnet implants! Then we deposit whats left for the world to find! You who betray mankind, beware of your brothers keepers, for they will crown you with hell on earth! 
 Umar Templar Militant!

Mr. Jon Doe, living for hard cash with Room and Board where he could afford, one day was gone, leaving behind the hoard.  
There in the U-Store-It, behind bolted doors, the treasure of a thousand kings that beggars belief and afford. 
Vacuums, Drills, hundred small clocks and jewelry, all from dissolved households, all old, all brandnew and end danger of mold. 
Never get bored, digging through the hoard. Pans, Pots, cutlery, whole sets, still packaged as they where found near the dead. All the beautiful shiny things, a dragons, a magpies nest, the things you could not afford, are now in the hoard to humiliate all hoards.
Knifes, big,small, army, cowboy, goldish - knifes. Belts. Buckles. To collect beautiful things, to make the artifact mine, is to be human- is to be ownered.
The beauty whispering plans into your ears. You will repair the dysfunction, it will become your destiny. The hoard will make you rich, mighty, stylish, will give you abilities, to become a clock-maker, a artist, a painter, a electrician, all things can be yours in time. Just pop some tags. Just order the tools- then add them, wrapped in shrink-wrap to the hoard. Let it grow, let it brood, like a reactor core, whose radiation shall trans-mutate you into a shiny new butterfly.
You have enemies, who want to get to the hoard, the flea-market, ebay customers, the declutterers who want to throw it away. They are after you, out to get you, you know, because you have participated yourself in hoardheists.
Precious, precious, is mine- gollum! 
Take the collection of buttons and throw it into the container, the chest before the You-Store-It. You can still reconsider, you can take out more then you put in!
Separate what can be auctioned off and what is trash. Thats the way the hoard creeps in your head! Its voice appears in your mind! The materials, at least safe the materials. Metal, Glass, Chips, copper, separate the shiny from he dull. The high energy material from the worthless. 
And the work that went into it. If its made by human hand, it has to be worth the hours that went into it. A days work, that must be valuable on the market, put it on the fridge, on the pile of fridges, put it into the hoard beside the container.
Look at the devices, that can be brought back to life. The Super-8, VHS, CD, Vinyl, BlueRay, Neuro-Pearl players, just need a new cord and they are good as new. Even have some media-cartridges with it, its basically a set and you are set.
So what if the beams sag beneath the load, the hoard is worth it, so what if the hoard could crush through the floor, accelerating on the way down through other lifes, other hoards, pancaking all life into one giant hoard coming to rest in the cellar. You can hear the crushed and buried sing of joy beneath the heap! Oh hoard wont you buy me a color tv, my friends all hoard porsches i wait for delivery till about three. Oh hoard wont you buy me.. a Mercedes-Matchbox-car! Never opened!
Pedicureset, Feetwarmer, feet massager, nail trim set, original wrapped, hair trimmer, nose-hair trimmer, surgery tools, late-night-shopping-tv-cart. Secretly glad, that the shiny stainless steel is forever yours, because nobody ever buys hygienic articles second hand or feet. Chemicals, disinfect, Roaches-Get-Wrecked, air-freshner, fabrique softener, reality-fixer-upper.
You want that to remain in your labyrinth forever, the urge to not carry it outside, to bury it in the corner - overwhelming. To become the keeper of the grail of all things spewed forth by industrialization. Your subconcious makes new lies, new roles, new jobs, new dreams. "It belongs into a museuem, a collection, i shall be the curator. I will give it to good will once i have a full set. We shall build a ski-resort on the slopes of mount-hoard." 
We had such plans, there would be order, not a hoarder, screwed mountings on the wall, boxes sorted by content. Even comfy furniture, cant throw that away! They where brand new! Shrink-Wrapped out of cold, dead hands!
Vacuums, ever more vacuums, the tools of the trade, accumulate with the trades of the tools, the heap, the boxes on boxes. Whats in the mystery box?
Who knows, but it comes in a box - you can use a box, to store all sorts!
Swivel brooms, coins, clocks, suspicous many clocks. In between unwrapped loveletters from the system that made the hoard. "Dear Mr Doe, please transfer on this account 25 Euronin to show us good intent.." because of cause he went into debt to catch them all. Inkassoletters, packaging undamaged, blood-letters, vampires - other hoard collectors, banks and heaps stalking the night.
And the riches of the hoard, would reward him a thousandfold. Nostalgia, alone would make it worth while the things you wanted to have as a kids, the others would pay a fortune for the polaroids, the discman, the portable tv, the artifacts of bygone times. Electric tin opener!
Mystery USB, peek into another life, now for the world to see.
Christ on a cross, brass, holy - you can not throw that away, oh one nail got loose, now christ in the hand, can sell that as a knuckle-iron near the train station. Turn the other cheek into a bloody mess! Every accident an opportunity! 
"Life with me, im your only love!" the hoard murmurs, and you agree. You should stash food in the hoard, cans of fish, corned beef, spam, durable, everlasting like you and the hoard. Coffemaker- beans included, watercooker, heatingplates and microwave. Refigerator boxes, coolers. Had they cables to connect them, where they clean, priceless, humanity has tainted white gleeming perfection - sleeping bags. Tents. Survial for several apocalypses, including private bankruptcy.
Now, that civilization has given its best, it would be ideal, to camp out in the woods with the goods, thriving without strangerdanger.
Cleaning chemicals, because dust, rust and mildew will diminish the hoard. You goto fight physics, with anti-smell spray, moisture collectors, deruster. Goto buy the tools, to keep the hoard new and shiny. All day, polishing silver, the sweat tarnishing it. If you loose it, just rebuy it, saturate the world with wrenches.
Golden champagne cooler, for the days of celebration and victory to come. Champagne, perfume in large batches, original wrapped, and of course other canned drinks, if you need to hideout, to hole in, if the world that besieges the hoard of hoards, the siege draws the siege circle ever closer on the lord of hoards.
Privacy, privacy i demand, with old photos in the heap looking at themselves, the forefathers of the hoard, demanding protection.
To the lonely Corner, broom! Hear your doom. Then the avalanche, crashing over you, the battery driven grandfather clock, kills you, the landslide takes you down, smiling skulls in the heap of others like you, happy at last. Victory is at hand, layers, and layers of victory!
For the hoard!
