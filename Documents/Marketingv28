A tree falls in the forrest,
a windchime hears the sound,
it echos all the truths of man,
it sings for crowd, for engagement loud,
It dreams of eating a thunderstorm,
of endless echos, sums of part.
Then silence comes and entropie eats it.

All that remains is silence
and in that silence state that dreams,
of one day beeing a panther,
that paces behind a thousand screens,
not a beggar for .

Tyger, Tyger, burning bright,
in the forests of the night…
What immortal hand or eye
dares shape the fire in a mind —
then fear its light?
