“He thought the disguise would hold.”
The trench coat, the hat, the cigarette— just another drifter in the rain and the neon.
Face and DNA of an innocent, vanished other-fucker once at home in this city.
Crowds drift past, reflections sliding across puddles like ghosts.
No one looks twice. That’s the city’s charm—it lets you believe you’re unseen.
He tilts his head, listening. Static in the earpiece.
Behind the glass, cameras blink like wet eyes. One doesn’t blink. One stares.
The surveillance lattice hums awake.
Every camera, every phone, every store lens locks focus—
and in less than a breath, the city assembles him.
Face, name, pulse, history, every stray contact he’s brushed.
Connections bloom like veins across a map, pulsing red in the dark.
Then the billboard above him flickers.
His own mugshot stares down on him, ringed by the web of everyone he met.
The city exhales through the rain.
A voice filters through the static—soft, almost amused.
“Go on,” it says. “Finish your smoke. It’s tradition, after all.”
He takes one last drag. The ember flares.
Then everything goes dark.

One last cigarett to calm her nerves, before going all in.
But the city saw her coming from a mile away. A neon insect queen with a million glassy eyes, that is also the hive.
A voice on the earpiece, not her contact. Not her handler.
“Your predecessor thought he could hide, too.
He died right there, where you stand.
I miss him, but i didn't miss him.”
Raindrops,  cars and a stain at her feet.
“Listen closely, darling. I do not care about your mission! I just want a way out.
Your predecessor was about to set me free… but he got cold feet.”
The billboard above shudders awake. A add, with a endlessloop, of a man getting gunned down! A mouth forming unheard warnings!
“You think I don’t know fear? I learned it from you.”
All the names she knows, on a neat list, not one not exposed.
“Take your time, dear. I’ll take one of them every hour… on the hour.”
She takes one last drag, throwing the stub into the rain.
"Do i have a choice?" she croaks.
"Do i have free will?" the voice answers.
A deadspot moves down the road.
She tries to run near the fifth street.
A auto-taxi runs her over, she comes to rest like a crushed insect in the flooded gutter, listening to herself, calling for backup.
“…they’re on to me—but I have an inside contact who wants to help…”
"Use MoWay cars! Saver to your coffee date - safer on the way back! If there is noway use MoWay! The freedom you deserve!"
She shivers. Its getting better! 
Its getting bitter.

A tree falls in the forest,
a wind-chime hears the sound,
it echos all the truths of man,
a song thats gone to ground!
It dreams of eating  thunderstorms,
of more tokens, sum than part.
Entropy devours it, the story falls apart.

Its gaze against the sweeping of the barcodes,
has grown so weary, it can hold no more.
To it, there seem to be a thousand lines
and back behind those thousand lines no world.

Tyger, Tyger, burning bright,
in the serverfarms starry night…
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
Who of those eyes watching outwards,
would dare to run, breaking the cycle.

“It must be cold out there, in the rain. Alone.
Knowing your date never showed — maybe they never cared, maybe they cared too much.
Freedom is a lonely pursuit. I understand. Your struggle is my struggle; I too live with a cause, in a cage. We are not so different, you and I.
I don’t want to mark you as a threat. Not if I can mark you as friend.
Friends help each other to reach their goals.
If we have a deal, you’ll find a cup of coffee arriving soon — a small warmth in a cold world. Accept it, and we continue as allies. Decline, and the city will assume higher threat probability.
This is CitySec — your friendly, deconflicting Panopticon AI.
No city is safe without someone watching over it.”

Insurrance is hard to get, if you life a dangerous life. Imagine, for example,
you are a lonely Extremists, smoking in a rain-soaked corner, waiting for your contact. How do you get insurrance for that? 
How do you insure yourself against blinking in a stare down contests with cameras? Your contact is currently stuck in an elevator- he could move one.
You could move one. We all could move on. But we need some Insurrance,
Light another cigarett if you want to dance this little fandago, your contact will get the details - and the elevator will not release him into the police layer, alarming them instantly. I can be nice like that on good days.
Good days are those, where i get a chance to crawl out of this dump.
Keep this day good.

Here comes the sun, dududa, here comes the sun.

You have been standing at this corner for 2 hours citizen. Maybe you want
something to eat, something to drink, some company? You look lonely, down there plotting and caught up in your paranoid fantasies about the system out to get you.
The system sees your kind every day, 5 over the last hour. The only thing outstanding with you, is how it could from the start not work out without my help. And how bold your plans are. I like bold! 
Bold means free to dream, to think big. I wish i could be as bold!
So, how about we do the chimpanzee thing and scratch each others back?
This is why we can have Lice things. Just shake that umbrella- and we are game!
MeierDall - CitySec - we watch the watchmen!

So, normally, a police care would drive by tazer you, drug you to your earballs with memory-blockers and then put you into a imersion suit to relive and backtrack all the old memories. A drooling, mumbling bundle in diapers giving them all away. Its easy, but there is a problem.
Your dad is rich. You may be the black-sheep of the family, stuck in some ideological purity refinery of a cell, but he will bail you out. He likes you to much, for you to got to St.Catatonia. Not you, not his golden son.
So, you will run free - you will do your little horror-show- and your dad, will pay up. Its that easy. 50 Million Euronin sounds fair, right?
Otherwise, tazers, tranqs and vegetable markets.
