In the olden, golden times, humanity had the luxury to do tons of foolish things- name dogs owners of large buisnesses for example.
Even back then they already developed technology to herd idiots. So if you want to steer stupid family members away from self-harm, but do not have the time - try the Sputnik ActiveMeasure AI. Our AI uses russian bots to gently steer idiots into acting for their own good by grabbing them by the emotions.  "If you dont clean your room, that virtual horse will suffer." (A horse was a 4 legged animal used for transport and sport.) 
Deep down, they know they are retarded and want to be steered, why else would they cling to the biggest bully there is. So better you with their best interests at heart and Sputnik ActiveMeasure AI - St.Petersburg Institue of Technology.
