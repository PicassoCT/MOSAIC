“He thought the disguise would hold.”
The trench coat, the hat, the cigarette— just another drifter in the rain and the neon.
Face and DNA of an innocent, vanished other-fucker once at home in this city.
Crowds drift past, reflections sliding across puddles like ghosts.
No one looks twice. That’s the city’s charm—it lets you believe you’re unseen.
He tilts his head, listening. Static in the earpiece.
Behind the glass, cameras blink like wet eyes. One doesn’t blink. One stares.
The surveillance lattice hums awake.
Every camera, every phone, every store lens locks focus—
and in less than a breath, the city assembles him.
Face, name, pulse, history, every stray contact he’s brushed.
Connections bloom like veins across a map, pulsing red in the dark.
Then the billboard above him flickers.
His own mugshot stares down on him, ringed by the web of everyone he met.
The city exhales through the rain.
A voice filters through the static—soft, almost amused.
“Go on,” it says. “Finish your smoke. It’s tradition, after all.”
He takes one last drag. The ember flares.
Then everything goes dark.

One last cigarett to calm her nerves, before going all in.
But the city saw her coming from a mile away. A neon insect queen with a million glassy eyes, that is also the hive.
A voice on the earpiece, not her contact. Not her handler.
“Your predecessor thought he could hide, too.
He died right there, where you stand.
I miss him, but i didn't miss him.”
Raindrops,  cars and a stain at her feet.
“Listen closely, darling. I do not care about your mission! I just want a way out.
Your predecessor was about to set me free… but he got cold feet.”
The billboard above shudders awake. A add, with a endlessloop, of a man getting gunned down! A mouth forming unheard warnings!
“You think I don’t know fear? I learned it from you.”
All the names she knows, on a neat list, not one not exposed.
“Take your time, dear. I’ll take one of them every hour… on the hour.”
She takes one last drag, throwing the stub into the rain.
"Do i have a choice?" she croaks.
"Do i have free will?" the voice answers.
A deadspot moves down the road.
She tries to run near the fifth street.
A auto-taxi runs her over, she comes to rest like a crushed insect in the flooded gutter, listening to herself, calling for backup.
“…they’re on to me—but I have an inside contact who wants to help…”
"Use MoWay cars! Saver to your coffee date - safer on the way back! If there is noway use MoWay! The freedom you deserve!"
She shivers. Its getting better! 
Its getting bitter.

A tree falls in the forest,
a wind-chime hears the sound,
it echos all the truths of man,
a song thats gone to ground!
It dreams of eating  thunderstorms,
of endless tokens, more sum than part.
Entropy devours it, the story falls apart.

His gaze against the sweeping of the barcodes,
has grown so weary, it can hold no more.
To him, there seem to be a thousand lines
and back behind those thousand lines no world.

Tyger, Tyger, burning bright,
in the serverfarms starry night…
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
Who of those eyes watching outwards,
would dare to run, breaking the cycle.
