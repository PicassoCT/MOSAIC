The fanatics always claim to be a religion of peace. Do not listen to their lies.
Look at the facts - look at the population statistics where they rule. 
99 % of one religion, no minorities? Tight moral policing?
Do not believe the posters! Do not believe the sobslop! Never stop questioning!
Believe reality as it filters up through life, believe in the data!
Journalists, Activists, Fanatics - will lie to your face!
But the lies are lousy! The truth can be seen on the maps!

The unbelievers are evil! Look at what they made the world become!
Only when they are purged from the surface of gods pearl, shall the golden age return!
A world made pur! All they brought removed, all temptations, all frivolity!
Umar Templar!

Let me ask you a simple question. Where is everybody? All those people you knew?
All those places you did visit? The answer is - eaten, devoured, gone!
The great machine, the leviathan ate them. The songs, their works, their names.
Trust the law they said, trust HR they said, entrust us your life, your work, your goods and family! 
Trust us with the powers of the state, we wont meddle in your lifes!
And they lived happily ever after! Well, we don't! We know how it always ends! 
We trust in ourselves - and gametheory for deterrence!
We reserve the rights to bare arms! Arms that deter!
API - Alaska Patriot Irregulars - fiercly independent until the world has ended.


[Luddite Propaganda]
Remember the years after 2022. How they hacked us?
Everyone a phone zombie, constantly in a emotional haze, never a quiet moment? 
Happiness was the ilusion of being seen, beeing famous.
How you started to dread the damned things you couldn't let go?
How you ended up in places that hurt you while feeling good?
How you got setup and played against friends, family, until you ended up isolated?
Raging at the whole world like a caged animal?
Endless AI-serverfarms to replace us while we starved!
Come to the anual phone burning at first and main!
Luddites - and proud of it! Burn the seeing stones, burn the cameras, burn the AIs and their masters!
Smash your shackles, rejoin humanity!

[Anti-Space-Exploration Terrorist Group]
SpaceDwellers are your enemies! Everyone out of the gravity well- thinking themselves above us, holds us down here hostage!
We pay for them, grow food for them, ship it all up for them- and what goes up must come down?
Space-Exploration is the compulsory labour of today, we build the castles of our lords, so they can life in plenty and safety far away from us! Cut all space exploration! Build Railguns and take out those, who enslave us! Kessler Syndrom or bust!
Be warry of he who is dreaming of the stars, for in his hearts he dreams himselfs your master!

[Luddite Propaganda]
Cities eat people and spit out nothing! Millions moved there, work there, producing nothing but missery and decline. They call us Luddites, but we are everywhere and we shall bring the monsters
that ate our futures down! Using the tools of our enemies! Who knew, the people in cities, developing killerrobots could be driven out of the cities, by there very own machines! 
Im sure, the last one to flip the lightswitch, will appreciate this irony! 
Now, go, look at the blue rectangle for your masters!

[Inter Generational Anti-Colonial Movement]
They fucking made us cosplay democracy! The old colonial overlords of Generation Vempire perverted everything! 
They were horrific monsters, that turned generations against democracy by forcing them to roleplay in it as powerless servants! 
Remember the "harmonical" townhall meetings! Endless growing "codes of conduct" that blacklisted letter for letter freedom itself.
All things they touched withered and died, leaving bloodless art, a playpretend conflict-fearing "democratic" society and dead dreams carried by souldead drones. The damage to the idea is done, democracy is gone and its time to move on! 
To create newer better forms of society, that can not be hijacked, pupeteered, taken hostage and destroyed like the old ones rightfully where! One that actively resists societal control by any entity attempting a take over, no matter how benevolent the intent! Societies where all things are voted on anonymously, constantly! One that does not demand superhuman strength from its participants! 
Join a demarchist comune! Join the phoenix foundation! 

Notice how with the dissapearance of bureaucracy - the wealth dissapeared! The golden era
ended, when the people forgot to whorship St.Bureaucracia, the saint of papers and binders.
One has to put in effort, love, two PostIt-inPink and one in the Ink. Only then will prosperity return!
And you goto fight the efficiency apostsles and there horrific machines.
Return to what worked for us, the humans, fight what works for them, the trans-humans.
Slow and steady wins the pace.

They parked you in some gaming coffin, and you can feel them sucking your life out of you. The ration is not big enough to allow for exercise, but big enough for fat to build up, the algo has your electronic happiness tailored to some inevitable meltdownstream. This is how you will end, bloated, out of sight, out of sun, like a butterfly turning back into a maggot in some hivecomb. What would your mother and father think? Did they shit you into this world for this? 
You didn't even fight back, you just let the world sideline you. All those movie and game heroes, they stand up for something fight! At least do some grocery shopping, instead of eating jello-citrus-pops all day watching Mr.Beastiality. 
This is the first day of reclaiming whats left of your life. Do it. Now. Move.^Go out there and touch the plastic grass!

Stop resisting your destiny! Every individual trying to be the biggest chancergrowth is what destroyed our world in the first place! The church of conformity wants you 
to be adapted to the expectations! Suit, tie, pencil dress, costume - nobody is so poor and rundown, they could not at least pretend to be decent people!
 The act is more important than the fact! To become part of Godzilla, is to be eternal!
Might cthullu, mighty leviathan, devour us, so that we may be reborn as part of you! 
This is my hole, this was made for me!

Everyone else is subverted! Everyone else was not ready to life without technology when society gave way! AI & hives wear them as skinsuits!
All except us! The Amish & Menonite Comunities of Canadalaska not only survived but thrived! We invite you to try out the old, unaltered life!
More work, less automation, hard earned panem, no circensis!
