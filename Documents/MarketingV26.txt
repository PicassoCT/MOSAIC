Let me ask you a simple question. Where is everybody? All those people you knew?
All those places you did visit? The answer is - eaten, devoured, gone!
The great machine ate them. All of them their works, their families and names! 
Trust the law they said, trust HR they said, entrust us your life! 
Trust us with the powers of the state, we wont meddle they said!
And we lived happily ever after! Well, we did not! We all know how it ended! 
We trust in ourselves enought to trust gametheory for deterrence of repetitions! 
And where one of us, wears one of the Anit-Matter-rings - humanity thrives again!
API - Alaska Patriot Irregulars - fiercly independent unless the world has ended.
Molon Labe!

Remember the years after 2022. How we got hacked?
Everyone a phone zombie, constantly in a emotional haze? 
How you started to dread the damned things and couldn't let go?
How you ended up in places that hurt you while feeling rightous? 
You showed it to the other side so much, all that winning grindeda you down.
How you got setup and played against friends, family, until you ended up isolated?
Raging at the whole world like a caged animal?
Working to finance endless AI-serverfarms to replace us while we starve?
Come to the anual phone burning at first and main!
Luddites - and proud of it! Burn the seeing stones!

Cities eat people and spit out nothing! Millions moved there, work there, producing nothing but missery and decline. They call us Luddites, but we are everywhere and we shall bring the moloch that ate our futures down - using the tools of our enemies!

Now, go, look at the blue rectangle for your masters one last time!

When things in the city heat up you want to cool down, but a single AirConditioning Unit never has enough power.
