-BAR-Branch
	- a pica walks into a BAR
	- compile bar
	- run bar
	- create a compossable unitclass that has infinite pieces pointers + matrices, but does not a full memory copy of the model
	-> or add bakedown to onePieceModel after composure
	- optimize it for near zero-memory footprint (all pointers to one piecemodel, no copys)
	- make houses that type of unit

- sundirection not working out
- self-revealing of operators
- recruited civilians kill themselve

- startup bug
- all maps tested through
	- depends on memory stackoverflow solved due to building model copies 
- selfilu windows for buildings (seperate texture channel that blends in/out over) the time of day - does not apply to holograms
- normaltexture for asian buildings
- vannishing safehouses on upgrade
- minigame debbugging
- no alpha texture
- testgame:AI vs AI. 
- divide and conquer performance testing debugging /buildings /no buildings
