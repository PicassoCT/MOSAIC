Gouvernour:
Citizens of <white noise>,
Governour <white noise> speaking. We may have not seen eye to eye in the past. I distinctly rember beeing called a <white noise> interest puppet on demonstrations.
There are < white noise>. They are building a launcher. In this very city. If it fires, story is over.
Eye for a eye, city for a city.
We will open the arsenals, hand out weapons, to all citizens. Find them, before they fire.
Stop this madness, at all costs. All rights to privacy are hereby revoked.
