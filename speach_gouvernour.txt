Gouvernour:
Citizens, 
we never trusted one another.

Who cares anymore. They are building a launcher. <Noise> cells in this very city.
We all know what this means - the end. A Eye for a eye, a city for a city. 
Here is what is going to happen. Police will hand out weapons.
We will search the city. All rights, all privacy is hereby revoked.
I declare a state of emergency and a amnesty to any violations of law from now till sundown.  
End this before it ends us.
