This is an RTS game developed for the spring engine (www.springrts.com). 

Its the very near future, and on a planet ravaged by the disaster that is 9 billion people,
there is a city that is doomed.
The reason for that is the way conflicts play out in the future. Small groups, with the right, exponential tech,
can cause damage beyond believe.
All it takes is some backyard shed, with a homespun hyperfast missile and a anti-matter payload.
Your job, should you accpet it, is - to either make the worst case happen (Antagon) or prevent the disaster and save the world (Protagon).

It starts with a single agent, with the ability to go undercover in a bustling city.
Small beginnings, but that first safe house, will spawn many more - ready to die for your cause. 
In the cellars, backyards and safe-houses of the city, a hidden army grows.
Satellite cycle -Eyes in the sky - over it, ever watchful for that one revealing misstep.
Drones hum ready to take out the bold.

Cause its only ever one Raid, one Interrogation for your side to unravell the whole net of trust and treason.
One bad apple squeezed, will spill those s/he trained and whoever, wherever trained her. 
And you can go from there, if there is still time, there must be still time..

And when the time runs out, the world ends. Chaos ensues, protestors riot, friend turns against friend
Militias search the city for the rocket, while others flee the conflict-zone

In the end, they all try to run - even the most blatant madmen, runs from guilt, his home, his cell..

But nothing and noone is what is yet to come. 

Gods firey thumb will come down upon it.

Sometimes there is barely enough time for some condemned Gig-Worker to realize what they have assembled for that ever anonymous, ever absent employer.
For the future is a tricky place, filled with double-crosses and dangers.

Maybe there never was a cult-leader and all you followed was a long forgotten AI.
It could all be just a bad dream, something to wak up from and rub out of your eyes.
Then it comes, a deafening roar,  a noise to end all noises. On a pillar of fire rises your ideals, your work to judge you.

Then the hammer, comes down- on good and evil alike. A nuke, a godrod.

A eye for a eye, a city for a city.

So it has been, so it shall always be.

Men is men a end.
