This is an RTS game developed for the spring engine (www.springrts.com). 

Its the very near future, and on a planet ravaged by the disaster that is 9 billion people,
there is a city that is doomed.

The reason for that is the way conflicts play out now. Small groups, with exponential tech,
can cause damage once only doable by superpowers.

All it takes is some backyard shed, with a homespun hyperfast missile and something new as payload.
Your job, should you accept it, is - to either make the worst case happen (Antagon) or prevent the last disaster and give humanity one more day on this world (Protagon).

You are the man in the chair in this hours of despair..

It all starts with a single agent, dropped into a bustling city.
A first safe house, recruting more into a cell - ready to die for the cause. 

In the cellars, backyards and safe-houses of the city, a hidden army grows.

Satellite cycle - Eyes in the sky - over it, ever watchful for that one revealing misstep.

Drones hum ready to take out the old-fashioned, bold & stupid.

Cause its only ever one Raid, one Interrogation for your side to unravell the whole network of trust and treason.
One bad apple squeezed, will spill those s/he trained and whoever, wherever trained her. 
And you can go from there, if there is still time, there must be still time..

And when the time runs out, the world ends.

Chaos ensues, protestors riot, friend turns against friend, while the optimists still loot.

Sometimes there is barely enough time for some condemned employee to realize what they have assembled for that ever anonymous, ever absent employer.
Maybe there never was a cult-leader and all you followed was a long forgotten Glidergun DAO-A.I. dwelling in some P2P cellphone serverswarm?

It could all be just a bad dream, something to wake up from and rub out of your eyes.

Then it comes, a deafening roar,  a noise to end all noises. 
A pillar of fire rises, tempting the gods and world to judge them.

After that the hammer, comes down - on good and evil alike. 

A nuke, a godrod, Let there be light.

A eye for a eye, a city for a city.
