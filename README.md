Eventually it leaks.
Somewhere in this, your city, there is a rocket ready to be launched. Ready to end another city.
It always does and it always does that too late.
Around 5 corners, everyone knows everyone.
So they tell theire relatives to leave the target, tell theire believe brothers to leave the origin-city. A city they doomed to have gods firy thumb come down upon.
Even the most hardened cells loose it near the end, the mad-idea trying to stay alive in other crazed heads.
Through all the delusional haze, they sense, that they will be hunted into extinction for this atrocity.
Sometimes, just some hireling realizing to late what he has assembled, for that ever absent employer.
Then all hell breaks loose.
Riots in the street, as the crowd searches for suspicious people- tearing them apart in front of
the world watching, to recive redemption and avoid retribution.
There is no law, no hope and no god in a city shortly before and forever after a launch.
Then it comes, a deafening roar, a noise to end all noises, out of those bells, the burning cars, already darkening the sun, a pillar of smoke rises higher then all those others.
Chaff and decoys rain down from above all around.
Like a final statement on the hubris of monkeys it jabs into the sky.
One moment of realization, of horror on whats to come.
Then the madness resumes, some running towards the launch-site, lots of others desperatly trying to leave the doomed city.
Then the hammer comes down- on good and evil alike.
A eye for a eye, a city for a city.
So it has been, so it shall always be.
Men is men a wulf.
